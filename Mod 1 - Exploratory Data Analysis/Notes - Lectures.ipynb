    "# 1.2 Overview of stats and scales of measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "### Descriptive Stats\n",
    "Deals with collection, summary, presentation, and analysis of data in order to transform data into info that can be easily understood and interpreted\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inferential Stats\n",
    "Use data from a sample to make claims, predictions, estimates and test hypotheses about the chars of a pop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Population and Sample\n",
    "- Population set of all individuals or elements of interest\n",
    "- **Parameter** - Specific characteristic of a pop, fixed for a population\n",
    "- **Statistic** - Specific characteristic of a sample, sample stats varies from sample to sample\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "- refers to the facts and figures collected, summed and analysed for presentation and interpretation\n",
    "- it consists of individuals, variables, and observations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Individuals, Variables and Observations\n",
    "- **Individual** = object of interest in study - Ex. cars, cities, people etc.\n",
    "- **Variables** = attributes or characteristics of interest for an individual (ex. color, height, weight)\n",
    "- **Observations** = set of all outcomes or measurements collected for particular individual in study\n",
    "- **Data Set** = collection of all data observations in a study\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scales of Measurement\n",
    "- **Nominal:** arbitrary labels or names, no order *Ex. walk, drive, train, bus, other*\n",
    "    - Numeric codes can be used *Ex. 1 represents walk, 2 drive etc.*\n",
    "- **Binary:** special case of categorical with just two categories 0 or 1, true or false etc.\n",
    "- **Ordinal:** all properties of nominal data but with **order or rank**\n",
    "    - When numeric codes used, there is NO measurable meaning to the number differences but there is an order\n",
    "    - Ex. Education Level: 4 High School, 3 Under Grad, 2 Masters, 1 PhD\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Interval:** numeric scales in which data exhibits props of ordinal scale \n",
    "    - **diff b/w values meaningful and specified on fixed unit of measure**\n",
    "    - Ex. SAT scores - 500, 600, 750 - score ranked and differencs have meaning\n",
    "    - No true 0 point - 0 does not mean absence of value but indicates another value on scale\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Ratio:** all props of interval BUT **ratio of any two values is meaningful** and **has true 0**\n",
    "    - Ex. yearly income, 36k to 30k is 1.2 times more\n",
    "    - 0 income, worker didn't work, absence of a value\n",
    "    - Other examples: weight, height, time\n",
