    "### Probability Scale\n",
    "- Scale from 0 to 1\n",
    "- near 0 = unlikley to occur\n",
    "- 0.5 = 50/50 chance\n",
    "- near 1 = very likely\n",
    "- 0 = **impossible event**\n",
    "- 1 = **certain event**\n",

    "### Assignming Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classical Approach\n",
    "- finite # of outcomes, each of which equally likely\n",
    "- with 'n' possibilities, probability of 1/n for each outcome\n",
    "- example rolling dice\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relative Frequency Approach\n",
    "- data available to estimate the proportion of time the outcome will occur if we repeat experiment large number of times\n",
    "- often used to determine probs for a particular population \n",
    "- P(A) = nA / n\n",
